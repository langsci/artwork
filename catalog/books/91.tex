\btagline{Roots of language is one of the most influential books in Creole Studies.}
\bblurb{Roots of language, originally published in 1981, was the first work to systematically develop a theory first suggested by Coelho in the late 19th century: that the creation of creole languages somehow reflected universal properties of language.  These proposals were immediately controversial and gave rise to a great deal of subsequent research in creoles, much of it aimed at rebutting the theory.  The book also served to legitimize and stimulate research in language evolution, a topic regarded as off-limits by linguists for over a century. The present edition makes this out-of-stock work again available to the wider public and contains a foreword by the author bringing the theory up to date. }
